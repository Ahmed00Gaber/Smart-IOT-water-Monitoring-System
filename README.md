# Smart-IOT-Real-Time Tracking and Water Quality Monitoring
#System
GPS and Data Transmission:
• Utilize GPS modules to provide real-time tracking of the Aqua clean Scape's
location.
• Implement socket programming for communication between the server and client
devices.
• The client devices (equipped with GPS, TDS, and pH sensors) send data to the
server, including TDS measurements and pH levels along with their corresponding
locations.
Cloud Integration:
• Integrate with Adafruit Cloud to store and manage the collected data.
• The server continuously senses water quality data and sends it to Adafruit Cloud for
storage and analysis.
Alerts for Acidic Water:
• Integrate a pH sensor to monitor water acidity.
• Implement an alert system that triggers notifications or alerts when the pH level
indicates acidic conditions.
Second System: Mobile App Integration and Control
Blynk Cloud Dashboard:
• Establish a Blynk cloud dashboard for remote monitoring and control.
• Using Blynk APP to provide a user-friendly interface for operators.
Socket Programming for Communication:
• Implement socket programming on the server side to receive data from the Blynk
cloud and the mobile app.Alerts and Control Actions:
• Configure the system to receive alerts from the Blynk cloud or mobile app based on
real-time water quality data.
• Depending on the received alerts, automate actions such as activating pumps or
conveyor belts to address specific conditions.
User Interaction:
• Enable users to remotely control and monitor the Aqua clean Scape through the
Blynk mobile app.
• Provide a feedback loop, allowing users to receive information about the system's
current status and water quality conditions.

#Circuit Components
Circuit schematic that involves the MCP3008 ADC for interfacing pH and TDS
sensors with SPI communication, UART communication with a GPS sensor, and control
of a conveyor belt and pump using an L293D motor driver with a Raspberry Pi 4.
